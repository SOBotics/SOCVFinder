0,WHAT IS A CATEGORY,*,*,<br/> AIML consists of a list of statements called categories.  Each<br/> category contains an input pattern and a reply template. <br/> The syntax of an AIML category is:<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;  &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> or<br/> <br/> &lt;category&gt;<br/> &lt;pattern&gt; PATTERN &lt;/pattern&gt;<br/> &lt;that&gt; THAT &lt;/that&gt;<br/> &lt;template&gt; Template &lt;/template&gt;<br/> &lt;/category&gt;<br/> <br/> The AIML category tags are case-sensitive.  Each open tag has an<br/> associated closing tag.  This syntax obviously derives from XML.<br/> <br/>,ai.aiml

0,WHAT IS AIML,*,*,The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup  Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with other chat robot languages#Comma AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The pattern matching language is very simple#Comma for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns.   AIML is an XML language#Comma implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel#Comma especially to people with HTML experience.  An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the &lt;aiml&gt; and &lt;/aiml&gt; tags respectively.,ai.aiml
0,WHAT IS THE LOEBNER PRIZE,*,*,The Loebner Prize is an annual Turing Test sponsored by New York philanthropist Hugh Loebner. Dr. Wallace and ALICE won it in 2000.

0,WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME,*,*,The Game is played with three people#Comma a man#Comma a woman#Comma and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help#Comma the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale#Comma and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question#Comma '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original#Comma "Can machines think?"',ai.aiml
0,WHAT IS THE EXTENSIONAL *,*,*,Extensional" refers to the extension of the set#Comma i.e. the set of all things commonly grouped under a single name. <br/>  The "extensional" definition of a robot is the set of all things we  call "robots": R2D2#Comma C3PO#Comma Commander Data#Comma HAL#Comma ALICE#Comma...,ai.aiml

0,WHAT IS CATEGORY A,*,*,A" stands for "Abusive" clients who mistreat the robot or use a lot of scatalogical language.,ai.aiml
0,WHAT IS CATEGORY *,*,*,Experience with ALICE has allowed us broadly classify three groups of clients: <ul> <li>Category A - Abusive Clients</li> <li>Category B - Average Clients</li> <li>Category C - Computer experts</li> </ul> Category A clients are the people who say "Fuck you#Comma" "You suck"#Comma "Suck my..." and so on. Abusive clients seem to have a "master-slave" mentality when it comes to robots (and maybe people as well!). <p/>Category B clients are average people#Comma perhaps half of them under 18 years of age#Comma who more or less have a good time chatting with ALICE. <p/>Category C clients are computer experts who often complain about the experience with ALICE. They say it is "old hat"#Comma "just like ELIZA"#Comma and "nothing new here."  Their problem#Comma we think#Comma is that they can't (or don't) suspend their disbelief.  They are like movie critics watching a film.  We tell them#Comma it doesn't matter#Comma because we're not doing it for you.  Dr Wallace created ALICE for category B clients#Comma by far the majority of the audience.,ai.aiml
0,WHAT IS XML,*,*,<br/> David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible<br/> Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science#Comma XML<br/> is a moving target.  In the simplest terms#Comma XML is just a generalized<br/> version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags#Comma which<br/> look like HTML tags#Comma and assign to them any meaning#Comma within a context.<br/> AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized<br/> language for artificial intelligence.  <br/>    <br/> One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools<br/> to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an<br/> XML language is easy for people to learn#Comma if they are already<br/> familiar with HTML.  Third#Comma AIML programs contain a mixture of<br/> AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages)#Comma a considerable <br/> convenience for programming web chat robots.<br/>    <br/> A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.<br/>    <br/>,ai.aiml
