Hi Brian, I missed to mention that I want to de-couple the layers by not directly referencing the implementing assemblies for the layers. Instead I define the interfaces in an interface project for the respective layer such that only the interface project is referenced by the layer using it. Given this I still need a way to tell a module about the implementing assemblies for its layers.

@Peter : I do agree and usually do not use non const reference in function arguments. I used it here because I erroneously thought it would help compiler optimization.

One annoying snag with this: Since those sublist APIs are only available in dynamic mode, you have to make sure you set the Country field first if you&#39;re going to change it. If you change the country field after setting the others while in dynamic mode,  then you will lose all of your changes. Best to do a dry run in the UI to make sure you know the order the fields should be set.

1) change from string injection to parameters, 2) catch <i>specific exceptions</i> rather than catching any exception and assuming that the problem is &quot;too many users connected&quot; 3) dispose of your connections and commands by surrounding them with <code>using</code> blocks. 4) Once all those are done, post the <i>exact</i> exception, including message and location, to isolate the problem.

Please try the code as is and see if it allow to what it is suppose to do which is passing a parameter to an object from a test... You can mock the MyObj with a simple print function for instance...

Thanks. haha I installed around 3 days ago so I missed that update. Looks like I was using the wrong guide as well.

As a puppet noob I have no clue which is the correct choice. I was expecting that the enterprise console would pop back up once I got things working with Apache. Oh well.

Interesting question. I&#39;ll note that if you fail to export <code>bar2</code>, you get the expected error <code>.&#47;foo: line 1: bar2: command not found</code>, but the final call to <code>caller</code> does produce <code>bar1 AFTER: 3 main .&#47;foo</code>, so it looks like (perhaps) calling an exported function <i>from</i> an exported function has some effect on the call stack.

Actually the <code>timestamp</code> data type is also altered each time you update a record. Its meant as a solution for concurrency by versioning the record. When 2 processes try to alter the same record one of them will lose out because their <code>timestamp</code> no longer matches the one on the record.

In my code, I do not have objects that are defined as LIST&lt;Parameter&gt;, other than the ParametersCollection class inheriting from this type. Hence, in your example, I would not have a p2 variable of LIST&lt;Parameter&gt; type to sort. I&#39;m looking for a clean, hopefully succinct way to sort the type that is available, ParametersCollection, I am weak in LINQ and sometimes get lost in generics, but expect that the best solution resides there, so I was looking for help.

My guess is perhaps A has an interface that B implements, and OP wants an implementation to test against. The correct answer, then, would to instead use a mock object, something like Mockito, in A to create a mock of the interface and thus never have to reference B.

@John: <code>&quot;I guess I will have to create multiple columns in the database&quot;</code> - Well, you can do that if you really want to.  But there&#39;s no rule that says you <i>have to</i>.  Having a database table with many almost-always-null columns seems like a pretty poor design choice.  I can&#39;t stress enough the fact that this is client side code and has <i>nothing</i> to do with a database.

@StackFlowed but the question says &quot;unable to change the location of any files&quot; which implies creating a 3rd jar from the common pieces is not an option. If combining into one project is an option, that works. If factoring into a 3rd (common) jar is an option, that works. I suppose the other question is &quot;if A doesn&#39;t already reference B, why would you possibly need to create an object from B for a unit test?&quot;

Unless you traced all the user&#39;s sessions or you have a crud-load of auditing enabled you probably can&#39;t get all of them.

Hmm, I don&#39;t think I explained this well enough. My end goal is a dataframe with the columns &quot;id&quot;, &quot;name&quot;  and then 150 columns for the &quot;value&quot; from each of the 150 files. If a file has a value for that &quot;id&quot; &quot;name&quot; combo I want it, if it doesn&#39;t an NA is fine. If I stack them, then remove the duplicate &quot;id&quot; &quot;name&quot; entries, won&#39;t I remove the associated data?

Hi David.  I was trying to avoid having 50 options in a single select statement.  I am using java script to choose only the options that apply to a specific topic...ie, filtration shows only the options under the select statement for filtration, but since the data in all the select statements will be inserted into the same column in the database, I wanted to avoid having multiple select names that would in turn need multiple columns in the database.

This looks like a problem with the JCreator install. What you see is what the <code>java</code> command outputs when it is given incorrect options.  This may be a bug in JCreator.  You might be better off using a more robust IDE such as Eclipse and forgoing crutches like <code>EasyIn</code>.

Your anonymous block cannot have static references to objects that the anonymous block is trying to recompile.  You have commented out the <code>execute immediate</code> line that would call <code>dbms_output</code>.  I assume that you tried that initially and it worked then you changed it to have static references to the <code>perform</code> call.  That won&#39;t work-- both of the calls would need to be dynamic.

The directory I want to limit access to is filled with files from a 3rd party. I have no control over if they use a framework or not. I agree 100% with your comment though, if only it was that easy for me. I need to avoid touching the code as much as possible.

Try using the <code>-Y</code> option when setting up the SSH connection.  This will work only if the local system is running XWindows.  If the local system is Windows you must have an XServer installed and configured (i.e. Cygwin-X or some other XServer)

A &quot;do-nothing&quot; option feels bloated. Even if I had room for a 3rd radio button, I&#39;d rather just allow the user to uncheck a selection.

I think the link Larme mentioned would give you a right direction. Create a thumbnail on-demand, and overlay that on top of your player (perhaps also a Play button), and in this way you don&#39;t have to play and pause right away

There&#39;s no way to do this just for one directory. There&#39;s a global <code>auto_prepend_file</code> option, but it applies to all scripts in all directories.

One caveat to be aware of is that sometimes there won&#39;t be anything stored in a <code>data-</code> attribute but there will be data stored in jQuery and vice versa.

I don&#39;t know what the additional functions in there do, but if it is as simple as it seems, I wouldn&#39;t worry about timeouts. You would likely need over several million &quot;cells&quot; (row/column intersections) before you would timeout. If you think this is a problem still, it isn&#39;t hard to profile this bit of code with microtime to find out how long it takes to perform these actions. You could also use an actual profiler like xdebug and get times/memory usage.

Where you put the images has nothing to do with the template. The handler that serves those files has to be able to find them.

The exception occurs intermittently in my live code, where there&#39;s a lot of other things going on (derived lists of derived list, etc); it could possibly be something else, but the issue goes away when I comment out this code.  I did try to replicate the issue in a unit test but was also unable to do so.  If I can figure out a way to systematically reproduce the error with some example code, I&#39;ll definitely post it here.  In the interim, sorry for not providing a more meaningful question.

I don&#39;t know Scala, so this is a bit of a guess, but <code>translateXProperty()</code> returns a <code>DoubleProperty</code> which is a <code>WritableValue&lt;Number&gt;</code>. Hence the second argument needs to be of type <code>Number</code>. I&#39;m not sure how Scala interprets a literal <code>0</code>: maybe instead <code>new java.lang.Double(0)</code> would work.

Then put the logic you want to test into a separate method. You cannot and should not test for console output. Rather define some method like isPortInvalid and test this method. And if you downvoted me, please check again if my answer is so wrong.

No. Figure structures are like a maze to me (I rarely do plots). But if you don&#39;t want to write your own boxplot function, and you don&#39;t want to change the code of the existing boxplot, then that&#39;s the only option you have left. Have fun.
