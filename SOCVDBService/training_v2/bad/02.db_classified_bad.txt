@Tom You convinced me. John deserved the downvotes and I shouldn&#39;t have said anything in his defense. In fact, I should have humiliated him myself.
my god please stop thats decent annoying
I take it that the person who downvoted is just an idiot then....
@Dima Idiot, how can you dare to complain me about the code if reformatting it will eliminate the issue? You won&#39;t spend time if issue is gone. But it won&#39;t help to explain it. I am asking those who will do it.
i know that idiot. read this
Listen everyone who clicked minus, my mum has just told me you all must support iceland, shame on you all.
SO Haters gonna hate, people calm down, newbies doesn&#39;t know about anything.
Why are you wasting your time here then. Go find new post
No problem ;D. I&#39;ll delete the comment. I was just thinking, WTF is he drunk? xD..
For god sakes, first that&#39;s not a timer, but a fucking stopwatch. Second, GOOGLE it, you&#39;ll find it a zillion % chance.
Ok. Hope you guys are happy for harming my rep. Bye.
Hey, watch the way you speak to me, asshole.
You mean the idiot before me, right? Because he is the one that insulted me first.
Very nice, you delete my comments but not his despite he is insulting me. You dont play very fair, do you?
mother fuckers who down vote this question.... son of bitch go to hell
Maybe he is a bad Googler? lol
@sgarcia thats the msot stupidest thing i have ever heard in my life
i&#39;m not that interested in earling points and commenting. i&#39;m content with wreaking havoc in my own way and re-creating my profile when the admins get butthurt and cut me off..
delete this comment butthurt admins i repost it all day
Downvoters: you suck. The accepted answer with positive votes is barely an answer at all in addition to being flat out wrong...
Why do people like u still exist?
It did work finnaly, i don&#39;t know what the fuck did happen earlier but, thanks! :D
@Anant wtf, you deleted your  comments,,,according to the rules, you are a pussy....
Go sleep , man..
The person who is reporting my comment as spam is my biggest enemy
This deserves a big LOL!
fuck your own cunt asshole
Go away. You&#39;re so immature. Obviously I&#39;m looking for a legitimate answer. Like WHY it&#39;s broken and how long until it&#39;s fixed. Did it ever occur to you that someone from Google or Galaxy7.
When I&#39;m listening to melancholy music and I read questions like this one I legitimately feel sad.
You&#39;re gonna be massively downvoted so I&#39;d suggest you delete your answer as it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE QUESTION.
comments must be comment. DON&#39;T YOU THINK YOUR ANSWER HAS NO MEAN FOR OP
@Kabeer Thats bullshit in a form which couldn&#39;t be more clear. When you build applications beyond the proof-of-concept scope you have to think about operational advantages and I can tell you, running mongo in production is a PITA. 
Go fuck yourself retard
notice how my retarded answer was the only one that got downvoted, cus my name is poopbagel. little experiment  :P
It&#39;s always happy hour somewhere... and this guy is there
you think I didn&#39;t know that command you idiot?
Obviously I don&#39;t know how to do it if i&#39;m here smart ass
@Vucko Shut the fuck up if your not going to help
note to people responding to my question: it so happens that i can&#39;t magically pull an understanding of c out of my ass
comments must be comment. DON&#39;T YOU THINK YOUR ANSWER HAS NO MEAN FOR OP
well, you again...DON&#39;T YOU READ THE CAPTION IS &#39;POST ANSWER&#39; NOT POST COMMENT YOU MTFCK
He don&#39;t care what you say about he, he a mother fucking P.I.M.P.
I wroted it myself u cyberbullies. Stop.
It&#39;s just one of the utterly unbelievable things about Apple that they haven&#39;t fixed this.  That, and the fucked-up graphics cards in MBPs.
destroction ass!!!!!
sorry for the stupid website (with all the adds) but didnt really want to register anywhere for this
Of coufse can code asynchoslu, but rezlize fuckon fo support
YOU NEED TO CREATE A QUESTION IT IS POSSIBLE TO ANSWER.
Did I say that I need your care?! Funny. I&#39;m tired of duplicated people like you so it is normal that you do not care and neither do I. Your comments to me are nonsense, let alone your down-vote. If you have a good point to throw.
hey guys... wtf
gradle and studio suck so bad.. eclipse was heaven compared to all this nonsense..
sounds like you need to go to your boss and then them that you overrated your experiences / skills when you had the interview.. good luck
shut the fuck up
What a funny kid ;)
@ishan Please don&#39;t encourage people who don&#39;t bother to make the slightest effort.
stack exchange is fill with epic douchebags...fuck stack exchange..you come in and troll and when i point it out you say..ohh you shouldn&#39;t have an attitude...fuck off if your not helping fuck off..otherwise your trolling dick head...and i thought yo...
fuck you and fuck stack exchange ...your the rude prick who came in trolling...they need to start banning dicks like you it destroys this platform keep people like you around
get some friends
... buy a book.
Are you kidding me? <code>0.25 == 6A</code> . Why? Because Coldfusion thinks 0.25 is a quarter of a day, and so is 6 AM. I think that a big WTF is in order here.
@EhsanAkbar you can pretend that you&#39;re polite and I&#39;m not, but I saw your comment that told me to &quot;shut up&quot; before you removed it.
to some it all up YOUR NO HELP please delete your post. i take a lot of offence to it
go to hell, 3 years ago I was in this community it wasn&#39;t like this ...
@EICaptainv2.0 Haha... Dont try to rescue yourself. Do you think john farkerson is a fool to help me with the precise updated code. Lol grow up man
Well, first of all I don&#39;t need lectures from you - moron.
I have one more question. Why are all you guys such assholes?
@Claies , I don&#39;t asking anyone to write for me the easiest custom logic in the world. Please don&#39;t jump to ridiculous conclusions.
did you even read the question? SO points do not convert into real life money so stop making pointless edit suggestions and stop clogging my post with your useless non contributions
@RobertLongson You people are really sick! You shouting out my post is duplicated... If i delete my post, you shouting out I cannot delete duplicated post.
Lol too much aggressive people for nieve to no reason tbh. You guys need to be more mature and to say something helpful for what I asked (topic) or better move on and leave without repling at all instead of being so butthurt for asking for help dudes grow up cuz I am not gonna take part of ur brain for asking for bit of script cuz I am sure it won&#39;t be that of huge script... done here
Guyes why are you down voting i&#39;m asking a question which i dont know,if you too dont know the answer just shut the fcuk up and dont downvote .. if you know the answer reply back
Go read a C++ book.
So many fuckheads here just voting a question without answering. Thats the new stackoverflow? &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know the anwser, my life sucks, but I am an idiot so I am voting.&quot;
What part of the documentation don&#39;t you understand?
I have one more question. Why are all you guys such assholes? I know i&#39;m an idiot. But why do you guys have to always leave snobby and rude comments on all the questions that are asked by the beginners. By the way when i said &quot;C sharp&quot; i mean&#39;t to say &quot;C#&quot; and things can be both Relatively advanced and simple textured, haven&#39;t  you ever heard of Minecraft? one more thing, how do I delete my account?
@aristos If you do not understand the homework, perhaps you should have listened when your teacher explained it.
Do you really think your answer might help on a 5 year old question?
And I asked for questions if I was not clear, not for someone to come by and ding me with a -1!  Do we have Trolls running dinging question because they are too amateur to understand?  Then on top of that don&#39;t state their reasoning!
What kind of jerk downvotes an accepted answer (3 years later) without explanation?
Shit language, shit community. Please unnaccept.
Hmm, so you dumbed-down the question and posted the real one in a comment.  I&#39;ll never understand that &quot;SO-users are morons&quot; strategy, don&#39;t care much for it enough to research either.
@CaptainObvlious I addressed that in the text. If you&#39;re not interested in such theoretical questions, then don&#39;t feel you have to waste your time here.
@ShawnS - No, you&#39;re the jerk!
Can any mother fucker answer me?
This is a statement of requirements. You have not actually asked a question. If you don&#39;t hurry up and turn this into a question the resident rule Nazis will close it. Four votes already, I&#39;d hurry up if I were you. They love their badges.
You didn&#39;t ask for more details in any of the above comments. You didn&#39;t say what you don&#39;t understand. You went on and on with &quot;no, you have no clue what you&#39;re doing&quot; &quot;you&#39;re doing it wrong&quot; &quot;you don&#39;t understand KO&quot;. My question is simple and clear, if you can&#39;t understand it, that&#39;s fine.

Bad. F<i>k</i>n. Ass.
That answer was Bad. Ass.  @Kyll lighten up.
If you dont mind can you get out of my way. Because while learning I cant give a **** to your rubbish.
Now people like you sucks teelou ! u had a prob, I have tried to resolve... it got resolved at all. then you made a mistake and again posted into web. I have resolved that again. And as it was tough for you, for your lack of knowledge you said WordPress sucks !!! you dumb !!! you are trying to become a coder ? as I said you to get some knowledge then comment , you downgraded my answer ? complete your study first. and try to respect them who is helping you out here. You are simply an uneducated creature.
People of this community should be aware of you guys. Shame on you !!!
I wasn&#39;t trying to waste your time or ruin your day, I don&#39;t think your answer was useful at all.  I hope your answer made you feel better.
Let&#39;s get back to the basics...
How the hell did this broken codedump non answer on a terrible question possibly got an upvote?
Get your tags right and stop wasting everyone&#39;s time.
fkn stackoverflow. Like the other day when I posted something correct, proven with code, and still got downvotes because it wasn&#39;t the answer some others were expecting. wtf.
I&#39;m voting to close this question as off-topic because it is little more than a blatant homework / work dump. If you&#39;ve put in work to try to solve this question, then please, by all means <b>show</b> your work, describe your efforts, and ask a specific and answerable question about <b>just what confuses you</b>. But please don&#39;t insult us by dumping your assignment on us with the implicit expectation that we do your work for you. That&#39;s not going to happen.
Also watch the Gif. maybe that will help your ignorant ass to understand
@Barmar How the fuck is this duplicate. I know how to connect, just not fetch.
this is the worst answer on SO
@nguyentu;  I don&#39;t think your attitude is going to encourage people to try and help you.
What the hell, are you serious?
Why do  you feed the troll @John?
wow this is the dumbest website ever.... every time I write a post I get negative comments and get turned off.... how are you to get answers if that&#39;s all you get....
@Kukeltje I won&#180;t feed the troll
Once again: Don&#39;t be rude to people who you ask to help you poor guy/girl
@Wingzero That is bullshit.
That code looks like poop and is full of spelling mistakes. Come back when you&#39;re ready to be serious.
I swear Stack has a horde of groupies out there :p
@TimPote: So fine. You disagree. Point made. Name calling and insults are hardly necessary, and I&#39;d think someone of your experience and rep here would know that already. There&#39;s no reason to get personal or rude just because someone disagrees wit
@TabAlleman So you&#39;re saying that the one evaluated last precedes the others? That&#39;s a contradiction and utter nonsense.
Are you kidding me? &quot;No I don&#39;t because you are the one that needs to learn&quot;? Your argument is that, because I&#39;m asking a question and you&#39;re the one supposedly providing useful information, you don&#39;t have to provide references, you can just say anything? What? That doesn&#39;t even make sense. What idiot upvoted that logic?
@mob , do you even know elementary programming? dumb ass, get out of here.
@ysth , why do you want to cover other&#39;s ass? if the OP had included the code WTF This was was posted? <i>You need to show the benchmarking code, too. A common mistake with benchmarks is to change the data without restoring it after each iteration. ิว
&quot;head of gamedevelopment&quot;?? I&#39;m sure its a joke - go learn some programming dude
fuk both of you and the stackoverflow community guidelines.  Offcourse this is ok, just because we&#39;re asking for references about something 100% programming related is not a problem at all.
thats the most possible worst option i have ever heard of @caeus
Thanks.! Some retard gave irrelevant answers and I didn&#39;t accept. He voted-down the question.. haha
It is very clear, but as somebody said before, the SO has gone to hell a long time ago. These days it&#39;s more like a pissing contest led by the people with high enough reputation to start pissing in the first place.
How the hell do you expect anyone to answer this question?
Doesnt any mother fucker know the answer?
Is the end-user really expected to go through all this crap?? I&#39;m ready to stab out my eyes and quit Android, if so. Holy shitballs !
Doesnt any bitch in this site know the answer?
I got 4 more downvotes yet no one tries to help me by telling me what the hell is wrong. Damn this community.
This is pretty obviously a troll post, but I have no idea if it should be deleted or just closed and left to contribute to the poster&#39;s upcoming question ban.
@BJMyers Calm down pal don&#39;t be such a party poop.
Where did I say they&#39;re wrong. I don&#39;t know if you can read or not.
Fuck you faggot
Well I am gobsmacked. I&#39;ve been reading the serialization code for twenty years and never seen anything like that. The incompetent moron, and I am choosing my words carefully, who wrote that drivel needs his head examined. All that was needed was a <code>BufferedOutputStream</code> temporarily wrapped around the target stream. Fortunately you can get around it by writing in 8k chunks and flushing them yourself.
BASTARDS!!!! LULZ
Charles again you are just being a sarcastic a-hole.  instead of even trying to answer you just make rude remarks.  I seriously don&#39;t get it
two words fuck u, there u go
Wow this is getting out of control.  I put a lot of work into my answer, if this question is going to turn into some sort of pissing contest that adds no value,  I can easily delete and get out...I think I understood what the OP was after.  If I didnt then please comment and I will delete it...I do agree that the original question could have some more detail.  If others understood the question, please post an answer, not just bash other users.
Lol, are those 5 lines really so complex that you&#39;d assume I had to copy/paste it? And even if that were the case, does that negate the fact that it&#39;s a valid solution to OPs problem? Get the stick out of your ass.
Then answer the question for him. Stop telling everyone that they are wrong and just answer the question for the kid
How am i suppose to show an api call to his own localhost? maybe his api is bad i don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t make a request to someone else local host. he has his own API maybe his API isn&#39;t returning anything, how am i suppose to know? How do i test someone else&#39;s localhost api? you can&#39;t. let the fucking guy try and stop being a faggot
It can take an hour or two to sort this nonsense out and most of us would rather not waste all our time for nothing
while([...]) { $skincareinuse=[...]; } will not get any more than one value. Please learn PHP before comming and insult people. You&#39;re not constructive, pretty much the opposite.
The hell are you blathering on about?
Hey!! What the fuck???
to everyone who put this question on hold i politely say to you: <i>Ahem</i> Get those sticks out of your asses. Thankyou.
@BenjaminGruenbaum &quot;Instead of being a dick&quot; I&#39;m guessing you can get away with any statement since you have in excess of 80,000 reputations, right?
@hugh Don&#39;t waste your time on silly online code judge contests. Solve real world problems instead.
I don&#39;t know the answer to the question but I see the downvotes and what I can say is that here are tons of dumbass abusing of that feature. The question is OK, for me they are just downvoting it because they don&#39;t know the answer.
@LogicStuff oh well. Honestly never tell someone to just give up what they are doing. It&#39;s ignorant and makes you seem like an asshole. Only reason I didn&#39;t say anything was I thought you were my only hope. If you&#39;re going to tell me to fix my
suck my left nut
Again, you are mistaken, and are proving dangerous misinformation. Shame on you. Here&#39;s a random one for you <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2006/jan/addslashes-versus-mysql-real-escape-string" rel="nofollow">shiflett.org/blog/2006/jan/&hellip;</a>
WHAT THE FUCK!! You take the time to delete my comments but not to give me a fucking answer???
@rjdown Well, it&#39;s not my &quot;small mind&quot; (thanks for being rude), it&#39;s the fact that the author does not know how to use the function properly (it is in the documentation, but I understand that 2 pages of english text is not an easy task f
If u have answer then give, otherwise u can leave it
@ADyson if u know the answer just tell it. Otherwise just leave it. don&#39;t put scene here.
Wow, you didn&#39;t even bother to write a proper sentence, why should anyone invest <i>any</i> of his time to answer this junk?
Tell your manager he/she needs to give the assignment to someone else
